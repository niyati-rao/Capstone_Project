# LPN (Learning in the Presence of Errors) Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the **Learning in the Presence of Errors (LPN)** problem using two core algorithms:

1. **Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) Algorithm** for recovering the secret vector.
2. **Sanjeev Arora's Paper** 

The LPN problem involves learning an unknown binary secret vector, `s`, from a noisy linear system of equations. This system is represented as:
\[ A \cdot s + e = b \]
where `A` is a binary matrix, `s` is the secret vector, and `b` is the noisy output vector. The vector `e` represents the error introduced to `b` with some error rate.

## Algorithms Used

### 1. **Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) Algorithm**
The BKW algorithm solves the LPN problem by reducing the system step-by-step. The algorithm performs the following:

- **Partitioning**: The rows of the matrix `A` and the vector `b` are partitioned based on their last bits.
- **Zeroing Rows**: In each partition, random rows are chosen, and others are zeroed out to make the matrix more sparse.
- **Majority Voting**: After each reduction step, a majority vote is performed to estimate bits of the secret vector.
- **Basis Vector Recovery**: Once the secret vector's bits are estimated, the basis vectors are recovered by further reducing the matrix and applying similar techniques.

### 2. **Problem Generation**:
The LPN problem instance is generated by creating a random binary secret vector `s` and a binary matrix `A`. A random noise vector is then added to `b`, creating a noisy system of equations.

### 3. **BKW Algorithm**:
- The rows of `A` and `b` are partitioned based on the last `i` bits of `b`.
- For each partition, a random row is selected, and the others are zeroed out.
- Majority voting is used to estimate the bits of the secret vector.
- This process continues until all bits of the secret vector are recovered.

### 4. **Basis Vector Recovery**:
Once the secret vector has been estimated, the basis vectors are recovered by applying a similar partitioning and zeroing out process to generate standard basis vectors.
